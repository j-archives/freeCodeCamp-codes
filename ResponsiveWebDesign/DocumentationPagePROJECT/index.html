                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a
                    host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide
                    programmatic control over them. 
                    <br><br>
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements
                    such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by
                    supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                </p>
                <ul  class="main-ul">
                    <li>
                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model
                        (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user
                        events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For
                        example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information
                        from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="main-paragraph">
                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language
                    resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression
                    syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
                    JavaScript.
                    <br><br>
                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based
                    on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based
                    object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
                    inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any
                    special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
                    <br><br>
                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and
                    methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to
                    implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

                <code>

                    greetMe("World");

                <p class="main-paragraph">
                    You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform
                    to certain rules.
                    <br><br>
                    A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be
                    digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the
                    characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
                    <br><br>
                    You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences
                    as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

                <p class="main-paragraph">
                    You can declare a variable in three ways: <br>
                    With the keyword var. For example,
                </p>
                <code>
                    var x = 42.
                </code>
                <p class="main-paragraph">
                    This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables. <br>
                    By simply assigning it a value. For example,
                </p>
                <code>
                    x = 42.
                </code>
                <p class="main-paragraph">
                    This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant. <br><br>
                    With the keyword let. For example,
                </p>
                <code>
                    let y = 13.
                </code>
                <p class="main-paragraph">
                    This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section id="Variable_scope" class="main-section">
                <header class="main-title">Variable scope</header>
                <p class="main-paragraph">
                    When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any
                    other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable,
                    because it is available only within that function.
                    <br><br>
                    JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is
                    local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5,
                    because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case
                    is an if statement.
                </p>
                <code>
                    if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5
                </code>
                <p class="main-paragraph">This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
                <code>
                    if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
                    not defined
                </code>

            <section id="Global_variables" class="main-section">
                <header class="main-title">Global variables</header>
                <p class="main-paragraph">
                    Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set
                    and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.
                    <br><br>
                    Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying
                    the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this
                    variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
                </p>

                <p class="main-paragraph">
                    You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as
                    for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric,
                    or underscore characters.
                </p>
                <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
                <p class="main-paragraph">
                    A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be
                    initialized to a value.
                    <br><br>
                    The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the
                    identifier is assumed to represent a variable.
                    <br><br>
                    You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:
                </p>
                <code>
                    // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
                    WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
                    //statements }
                </code>
                <p class="main-paragraph">However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.</p>
                <code>
                    const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
                    "otherValue";

                <header class="main-title">Data types</header>
                <p class="main-paragraph">The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Six data types that are primitives:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                        <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                        <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                        <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                        <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                        <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>

                <p class="main-paragraph">Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.</p>
